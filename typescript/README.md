# TypeScript configuration for Hurricano projects.

### Usage

First install the package - `npm i --save-dev @hurricano/ts-config`, and then add:

```json
{
	"extends": "@hurricano/ts-config"
}
```

To your tsconfig.json, which you can then modify how you like. This TypeScript config has been setup to be very strict, and is tailored towards Hurricano's projects.
